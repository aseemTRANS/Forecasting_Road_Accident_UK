# Forecasting_Road_Accident_UK

### Introduction
Urban data science is the use of data science methods to examine and comprehend urban environments and processes with a focus on spatial elements because they are essential to understanding the dynamics of urban life and its difficulties. It includes tasks such as data gathering, transformation, modelling, and visualization. To evaluate and forecast accident severity and offer insights that may improve urban safety and planning, this research focuses on accident data from the United Kingdom.

Since traffic accidents have a big impact on urban growth and health, they are a major problem in the UK. Reducing the frequency and severity of road accidents requires an awareness of the major contributing elements, which makes road safety a crucial component of public safety. The global road safety problem is a critical issue, with the WHO estimating that 1.25 million people worldwide lose their lives and up to 50 million are injured in traffic accidents annually (WHO, 2015). Roughly 1.3 million casualties of all severities were reported in the UK alone in 2022 (DfT, 2023).

Moreover, establishing predictive models for accident severity and comprehending the contributing variables to traffic accidents can result in safer solutions. It gives engineers, urban planners, and legislators the ability to put evidence based plans for reducing traffic fatalities and major injuries into practice. Identifying the factors such as location, risky behaviors, age and sex of driver, type of vehicle, day of week, speed limit, and environmental factors like time of day can all contribute to road accidents.

### Research Question
- What are the key contributing factors to road accidents in the United Kingdom, and how can these characteristics be utilised to predict the severity of an accident?
- What are the projected trends for the number of accidents, and how accurate is the model's forecast compared to real historical data?

### Objectives
- Daily and 7-Day Moving Average: Exploring Casualty Trends
- Seasonality Analysis
- Accident Analysis by Day of the Week and Time
- Accident Analysis by Age and Gender of Driver
- Accident Analysis by Speed Limit
- Predictive Model: Random Forest and SARIMA
